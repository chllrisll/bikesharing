# analysis overview
For this analysis, we use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

-- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
-- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
-- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
